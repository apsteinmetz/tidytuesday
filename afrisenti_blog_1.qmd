## Inspired by TidyTuesday

Some of the the R data science community participate in a weekly challenge called "Tidy Tuesday," where an interesting data set is presented for analysis but mostly visualization. There are some tremendous examples of beautiful work posted on [Twitter](twitter.com) with the hashtag #tidytuesday.

## African Tweets and Sentiment

Recently, the weekly dataset was a collection of over 100,000 tweets, apparently from 2022, in 14 African languages, with sentiment labels. The paper describing the set and methods is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08956.pdf) [@muhammad-etal-2023-semeval]. The TidyTuesday project and raw data are [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-02-28/readme.md). This is quite a diverse data set including many tweets in English, tweets in languages which, like English, use the Latin character set and tweets in other character sets, including Arabic.

I saw this as an avenue to ask a couple interesting questions.

1.  Can we apply sentiment analysis techniques to a translated version of this dataset? How good is Google Translate, anyway?
2.  Over the past year there has been much talk about the differences in attitudes of the "global north" vs. the "global south." Does this data set reveal anything about that?

I saw an opportunity to sharpen my skills in a couple areas, using the Google API for batch translation and using RStudio's Tidytext and Tidymodels toolsets.

I split these explorations into four snack-able posts.

1.  In this post we show how to use Google Cloud Translate to batch translate the entire data set.
2. Here we use the Tidytext framework to do sentiment analysis with word valences.
3.  Next, we'll compare machine learning approaches in the TidyModels framework to do sentiment analysis on both the native and translated tweets.
4.  Finally, let's use the already assigned sentiment tags to explore African attitudes to the "global north."

## Disclaimer

The usual caveats apply. I am not a social scientist. I am a hobbyist. This is an exercise in R coding so I make no claim that my conclusions about any of this data are valid.

## Get the Data

Here are the packages we'll need for this project.

```{r}
#| output: false

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(googleLanguageR)
  library(future)
  library(furrr)
  library(rvest)
})
```

The TidyTuesday github repo has the Afrisenti dataset with all the languages combined. Let's load it.

```{r}
afrisenti <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-02-28/afrisenti.csv',
                             show_col_types = FALSE)

afrisenti
```

## Translate the Tweets

To use Google translate in batch mode we'll need an API key. I dont' get Google. For some of their services, like Maps, a single API key is needed. For Translate we need a JSON file with the key. Once you get the key, store the file name in your .Renviron file with the key name "GL_AUTH" then the googlelanguageR package will automatically authenticate when it loads.

::: callout-note
Getting the Google Language API key is a complicated procedure and I won't detail it here but you can find complete instructions in the [googlelanguageR package introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googleLanguageR/vignettes/setup.html).
:::

Once once your key is created you can start translating with R. This isn't free. Translating over 100,000 tweet cost me about US\$15. A couple bucks was wasted because I submitted all the tweets including those in English. You might choose to filter English tweets out first. If you just want to work with the same data set you can download my translations (see below) for FREE.

I first tried shooting the whole data set into the translation routine but Google protested that I was sending too much. I divided the set into batches of 100 tweets at a time which fixed the probem.

We can speed things up using the `furrr` and `future` packages to allow parallel processing using just three lines of code.  `furrr` adapts the `purrr::map()` family of functions to allow parallel execution. Very simple. Amazing!

```{r}
#| eval: false
future::plan(multicore) # will use all available cores
batch_size = min(100, nrow(afrisenti))
afrisenti_translated <- 
  seq(0, nrow(afrisenti) - batch_size,
      by = batch_size) |>
  furrr::future_map_dfr(\(x) {
    gl_translate(afrisenti$tweet[(x + 1):(x + batch_size)])
    }, .progress = TRUE)
future::plan(sequential) # back to normal
```
It's worth looking over the code above because it packs a lot of power in few lines and, to me, shows how cool R is.

Basically, we identify the batches of rows from the data set we want to ship out to Google and translate them in as many parallel streams as our hardware allows.

Let's clean up the data a little.
```{r}
#| eval: false
# merge with source data and clean up a little
afrisenti_translated <- afrisenti_translated |> 
  na.omit() |> 
  select(-text) |> 
  bind_cols(afrisenti) |> 
  rowid_to_column(var = "tweet_num") |> 
  mutate(tweet_num = as.numeric(tweet_num))
  mutate(intended_use = as_factor(intended_use)) |>
  mutate(detectedSourceLanguage = as_factor(detectedSourceLanguage)) |>
  mutate(language_iso_code = as_factor(language_iso_code)) |>
  mutate(label = as.factor(label))
```
While it's not strictly necessary, I wanted to see the long names for the languages, rather than just 2-character ISO codes.  Using Wikipedia I created a file that we can use for reference. The `rvest` package makes turning an HTML table into a data frame easy.
```{r}
#| eval: false

# get languages from wikipedia
# take the second table on the page
iso_lang <- html_table(read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes#External_links"))[[2]]

# since Wikipedia is subject to frequent change, if the entry doesn't work
# you can get the file here
# iso_lang <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apsteinmetz/tidytuesday/master/2023-02-28_african_language/data/iso_lang.csv',
#                              show_col_types = FALSE)

iso_lang <- iso_lang %>% 
  rename(assigned_language = `639-2/T`,
         detected_language = `639-1`,
         language = `ISO language name`) %>% 
  select(1:3)

# clean up langauge names
afrisenti_translated <- afrisenti_translated %>% 
  mutate(language_iso_code = str_replace_all(language_iso_code,"pt-MZ","por")) %>% 
  mutate(language_iso_code = str_replace_all(language_iso_code,"ary","ara")) %>% 
  mutate(language_iso_code = str_replace_all(language_iso_code,"arq","ara")) %>% 
  mutate(language_iso_code = str_replace_all(language_iso_code,"pcm","eng")) %>% 
  rename(assigned_language = language_iso_code,
         detected_language = detectedSourceLanguage) %>% 
  left_join(select(iso_lang,-assigned_language)) %>% 
  rename(detected_long = language) %>% 
  left_join(select(iso_lang,-detected_language)) %>% 
  rename(assigned_long = language)
  
# save it for later use
save(afrisenti_translated,file="data/afrisenti_translated.rdata")

```
## Save Some Money
That done, YOU don't want to pay $15 and you don't have to.  Let's download the translated Afrisenti data set from my repo instead.  Then look at the first row.

```{r}
afrisenti_translated <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apsteinmetz/tidytuesday/master/2023-02-28_african_language/data/afrisenti_translated.csv',
                                        show_col_types = FALSE)

afrisenti_translated$tweet[1]
afrisenti_translated$translatedText[1]
afrisenti_translated$label[1]

```
A quick glance at the translation shows obviously negative sentiment.  We are off to a promising start.  In the next post we'll use the tidytext framework to measure the net balance of sentiment for each tweet.
